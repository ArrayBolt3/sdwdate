## If the same organization hosts multiple onion services, these must be
## grouped together as one.
## See the riseup example. The syntax is is an extra:
##       [
##       ]

## Comment Field Rules:
## The comment field, the part of the the hash ("#") for each pool member is
## shown in sdwdate logs. By convention the first part of the comment must be
## the corresponding clearnet domain of the organization hosting the onion.
## This is useful so users, reviewers can more easily see in sdwdate logs which
## organizations where used during sdwdate time fetching since it is hard to
## remember that xxx.onion belongs to or cumbersome to manually look up every
## time.
## Also included must be an link that confirms that the onion link belongs to
## the organization. I.e. is not an anonymous mirror, impersonating link, fake
## or scam. That link must also be archived.
## For links that are archived on archive.org it would be sufficient to only
## include the archived link since it is trivial to extract the unarchived link
## from any link to web.archive.org. Links archived with archivers other than
## web.archive.org such as archive.is must also be included in their
## unarchived form.
